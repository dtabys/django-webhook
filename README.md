# Django Webhooks ![badge](https://github.com/danihodovic/django-webhook/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

A plug-and-play Django app for sending outgoing webhooks on model changes.

Django has a built-in signal system which allows programmers to schedule functions to be executed on
model changes. django-webhook leverages the signal system together with Celery to send HTTP requests
when models change.

Suppose we have a User model
```python
class User(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    age = models.PositiveIntegerField()
```

If a webhook is configured, any time the above model is created, updated or deleted django-webhook
will send an outgoing HTTP request to a third party:

```
POST HTTP/1.1
host: webhook.site
user-agent: python-urllib3/2.0.3
django-webhook-uuid: 5e2ee3ba-905e-4360-94bf-18ef21c0e844
django-webhook-signature-v1:
django-webhook-request-timestamp: 1697818014

{
  "topic": "users.User/create",
  "object": {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Dani Doo",
    "age": 30
  },
  "object_type": "users.User",
  "webhook_uuid": "5e2ee3ba-905e-4360-94bf-18ef21c0e844"
}
```

### üî• Features
- Automatically sends webhooks on model changes
- Leverages Celery for processing
- Webhook authentication using HMAC
- Retries with exponential backoff
- Admin integration
- Audit log with past webhook events
- Protection from replay attacks
- Allows rotating webhook secrets
- Filter webhooks by model IDs or bucket

### üîç Filtering Webhooks

You can filter which model instances trigger webhooks using the `filters` field on the Webhook model. This allows you to:

1. Filter by a list of model IDs
2. Filter by a "bucket" attribute (if present on the model)

Example filter configuration:

```python
# In your Django admin or code
webhook = Webhook.objects.get(id=1)
webhook.filters = {
    "app_name.ModelName": {
        "ids": [1, 2, 3],  # Only trigger for these model IDs
        "bucket": "production"  # Only trigger if model.bucket == "production"
    }
}
webhook.save()
```

The filters are applied using AND logic - both conditions must be met for the webhook to trigger. If a filter type is not specified (e.g., no "ids" or no "bucket"), that filter is not applied.

### üß™ Testing Webhooks

You can send a test webhook request to verify your webhook configuration using the `send_test` method:

```python
# In your Django code
webhook = Webhook.objects.get(id=1)

# Send a test webhook with default payload
result = webhook.send_test()

# Send a test webhook with custom payload and topic
custom_payload = {
    "test": True,
    "message": "Custom test message",
    "data": {"key": "value"}
}
result = webhook.send_test(payload=custom_payload, topic="custom/test")
```

The `send_test` method:
- Sends the webhook request synchronously (no Celery task delay)
- Returns the result of the webhook request
- Creates a WebhookEvent record if STORE_EVENTS is enabled
- Throws an error if the webhook is inactive or if the request fails
